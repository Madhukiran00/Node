## MongoDB
### MongoDB is an open-source, non-relational (NoSQL) database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of tables with rows and columns

## ORM VS ODM

An ORM essentially translates object-oriented code into SQL queries and vice versa, abstracting away the need to write raw SQL. It allows developers to interact with database data as if it were a collection of objects, simplifying data manipulation and retrieval.

Similar to ORMs, ODMs provide an object-oriented interface for interacting with document databases. They handle the conversion between application objects and database documents, allowing developers to work with data in a more natural, object-oriented way
